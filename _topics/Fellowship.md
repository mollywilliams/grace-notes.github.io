**Fellowship 2**

In Acts 2, the church is born having an initial membership of something
more than 3000 men and women. The life of this group developed in four
specific areas, described in Acts 2:42. These areas were doctrine,
fellowship, breaking of bread and prayer.

These four areas of fellowship are described in two couplets, that is,
doctrine and fellowship are linked together, and breaking of bread and
prayer are linked together.

The Greek term for fellowship is  (**koinonia**). The following
is a brief word study on the meaning of **koinonia** as it relates to
man. Fellowship with God, as described in 1 John 1 is not included in
this study.

Definition

The word **koinonia** carries the basic idea of having something in
common. The word is related to  (**koine**), meaning common, which
we use to refer to **koine** Greek, the original language of the New
Testament, which was common to many people at a certain time in history.
Jude 3 speaks of our common (**koine**) salvation, referring to a
salvation known and shared by all believers. The best way to bring the
meaning of **koinonia** into English is to speak of joint participation
in something.

Areas of Joint Participation or Fellowship in the Early Church

**Koinonia in Material Things**

Romans 15:26, 27. The word contribution is **koinonia**.

2 Cor. 8:4, fellowship

2 Cor. 9:1, distribution

Gal. 6:6, communicate with

Phil. 4:15, communicated

Note that in each passage there is joint participation in something
material - money.

**Koinonia in Suffering**

Phil. 3:10, fellowship

1 Peter 4:13, partakers. Here is a godly believer participating in the
suffering area.

**Koinonia in Evil**

2 John 11, partaker in evil

1 Cor. 10:20, fellowship in evil

In these two passages joint participation may be had in evil by
expressing cordiality toward doctrinal error or by association with
idolatry. Matt. 23:30 speaks of **koinonia** in murder.

**Koinonia in the Incarnation of Christ**

Hebrews 2:14 shows that Christ became a joint participant with us when
He took on a human body.

**Koinonia at the Lord’s Table**

I Cor. 10:16 says that we have communion or **koinonia** with the blood
and body of Christ.

**Koinonia in Spreading the Gospel**

Gal. 2:6-9 tells how Peter, Paul and other apostles were given the right
hands of fellowship indicating joint participation in the spread of the
gospel.

**Koinonia in Salvation**

2 Peter 1:4 says that by the word of God we become partakers of the
divine nature.

**Koinonia in the Holy Spirit**

2 Cor. 13:14 and Phil. 2:1 both indicate a joint participation of the
believer and the Holy Spirit.

**Koinonia in a Common Effort**

Luke 5:10 expresses this where James, John and Simon are called partners
or **koinonia**. The joint participation was in the fishing business
which they all shared.

Summary

Fellowship in the New Testament means joint participation in some area,
defined by context. In no passage is fellowship presented as a goal or
end in itself. It is merely the by product of common goals or
possessions. The more the believer discovers the salvation common to all
other believers, the more fellowship occurs.
